      Terms & Conditions
    </h1>
    <p>
      By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
      therefore
      that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of
      the
      app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and
      you
      also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself,
      and
      all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still
      belong to SadEllie.
    </p>

    <p>
      SadEllie is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
      reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
      We
      will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
      paying
      for.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Unitto app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s
      your
      responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
      jailbreak
      or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
      official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
      programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Unitto app won’t work
      properly or
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Play Services</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics">Google Analytics for Firebase</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics">Firebase Crashlytics</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You should be aware that there are certain things that SadEllie will not take responsibility for. Certain
      functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi
      or
      provided by your mobile network provider, but SadEllie cannot take responsibility for the app not working at
      full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement
      with
      your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
      the
      cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
      using
      the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the
      app
      outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
      bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
      received
      permission from the bill payer for using the app.
    </p>


    <p>
      Along the same lines, SadEllie cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need
      to
      make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
      Service, SadEllie cannot accept responsibility.
    </p>


    <p>
      With respect to SadEllie’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important
      to
      bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on
      third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. SadEllie accepts no
      liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
      functionality
      of the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements
      for
      the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
      and
      you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. SadEllie does not promise that it
      will
      always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have
      installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to
      you,
      We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
      termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
      to
      you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
    </p>
